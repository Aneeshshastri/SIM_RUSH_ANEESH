# The Solar Flare Pulse: Stochastic Signal Recovery

##  Project Overview

This project implements a **Bayesian Parameter Estimation** pipeline to recover the physical properties of a stellar flare event from heavily noise-corrupted time-series data.

Developed as part of the **Simulation Rush** [By Elan and nVision] , the solution utilizes a **Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** algorithm to reconstruct latent parameters despite significant stochastic noise and signal dropouts. A key innovation of this implementation is the development of a robust **Mixed Error Model** to resolve numerical stability issues inherent in relative error models at signal zero-crossings.

##  Key Features

* **Robust Likelihood Function:** Implements a mathematically rigorous "Mixed Error Model" () to preven
* **Automated Noise Calibration:** Utilizes stochastic global optimization (Differential Evolution) nested within a root-finding algorithm to statistically determine the optimal instrumental noise floor ().
* **Adaptive MCMC Strategy:** Features a pilot tuning phase using Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation to learn the parameter covariance structure, followed by a stationary Metropolis-Hastings production run.
* **Precision MAP Estimation:** Extracts Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimates using guassian KDE

##  Installation & Configuration

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.8** or higher installed.

### 2. Environment Setup

It is recommended to run this project in a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate environment (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

```
If you're using Conda for your environment instead 
```bash
# Create virtual environment
conda create --name <env_name> python=3.13.5
conda activate <env_name>

```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required scientific computing libraries using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

##  Usage Instructions

1. **Prepare Data:** Ensure `flare_data.csv` is present in the root directory.
2. **Run Analysis:** Execute the main script. (Open your file on a Jupyter Notebook Environment (like colab, Jupyter, kaggle etc.) and run all cells



### Execution Flow

The script performs the following steps automatically:

1. **Noise Floor Optimization:** Solves for the instrumental noise floor parameter  such that the Reduced Chi-Squared statistic equals 1.0.
2. **MCMC Sampling:** Initializes a Metropolis-Hastings sampler at the global optimum and runs for 400,000 iterations.
3. **Sanity Check:** Validates the derived model against the raw data.
4. **Visualization:** Generates and saves plots to the `output/` directory.

## cientific Methodology

### 1. The Physical Model

The flare intensity  is modeled by the analytical function:


### 2. Statistical Challenge & Solution

The problem statement specifies a relative error model . This creates a mathematical trap where  as , causing the Likelihood function to diverge to infinity at zero-crossings.

**Our Solution:** We implemented a **Mixed Error Model**:


We numerically solved for the hyperparameter , which stabilizes the likelihood function and ensures the error bars are physically consistent with the observed data variance.
